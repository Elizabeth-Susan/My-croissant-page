    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough. The dough
      is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in
      a process called lamination. The final dough is cut into triangles and
      rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a
      layered, flaky textured roll, more like puff pastry. The main ingredients
      in a croissant are flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, water, eggs and
      butter. A well baked croissant should be flaky and crisp on the outside
      and tender and moist on the inside. It should be evenly baked and well
      aerated. How to Serve Croissants Croissants may be served at breakfast or
      tea or filled with cheese, ham, mushrooms or chicken.They are best served
      fresh, on the day of baking. Storage: croissants should be stored at room
      temperature in a paper bag because moisture tends to destroy the
      crispness. Croissants can be frozen in an air-tight container. To reheat.
      bake at 350ºF (180ºC) from room temperature 10-12 minutes or from frozen
      10-15 minutes. Croissants originated in Budapest in 1686 (Larrouse
      Gastronomique).
